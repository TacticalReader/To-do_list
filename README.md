## 📂 File Structure

The project is organized into a few key files:

```
.
├── index.html       # The main HTML file containing the app's structure and styles.
├── index.js         # The core JavaScript file with all the application logic.
├── metadata.json    # Project metadata.
└── readme.md        # This file.
```

-   `index.html`: Contains all the DOM elements and the complete CSS stylesheet within a `<style>` tag.
-   `index.js`: Manages the application's state (the `todos` array), handles all user interactions, manipulates the DOM to render tasks, and interacts with Local Storage.
